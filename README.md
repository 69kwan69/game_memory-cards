# Game: Memory Cards

This project is assigned by TheOdinProject. For more information, please refer to [their curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card).

A fun and classic memory game where you try to get all the cards while avoid getting the same card twice. Btw, the game has pokémon, so make sure not to miss them out.

## How to Play

- The game start with 20 cards of different pokémon.
- Player has to pick the card that hasn't selected previously.
- After each guess the deck will be shuffled.
- The higher the score, the harder it gets!

## What I've learned

I finish the project in 2 days, so it's should be easy enough to build. I struggled a bit when handling the API stuff and learned how it works (and be handled with loading and error stuff). I also learned that there are more optimal approaches out there, waiting to be explored.

P/S: I like how ChatGPT wrote a whole two paged exciting README for such a bland and boring game.
